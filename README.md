## Roadmap
Currently we're working on implementing all features that the current `LoLTrivia`-bot already has. Once those are in, we will build on that and improve things.

## IRC Info
We're in `#lolbottest` on `irc.quakenet.org`. The bot is mostly intended to be used in `#r/leagueoflegends` on Quakenet.
