If you want to contribute, you can follow the steps below:

1. Fork the repository
2. Pick an issue to work on and let us know that you're working on it to avoid duplicates.
3. Once it's done, create a Pull Request. Note that we use a git-flow based repo structure, meaning the latest dev version is on the `develop`-Branch. Make sure your PR merges into `develop` and not `master`, unless it is a critical hotfix.
4. We'll look over it and test it (manually for now) and let you know how to improve it and merge it once it's fine.

### Don't be shy and ask questions if you're stuck somewhere!
