## Roadmap
Currently we're working on implementing all features that the current `LoLTrivia`-bot already has. Once those are in, we will build on that and improve things.

## IRC Info
We're in `#lolbottest` on `irc.quakenet.org`. The bot is mostly intended to be used in `#r/leagueoflegends` on Quakenet.

## Hacktoberfest
We want to encourage new programmers to join and participate in Open Source-Projects. That is one of the reasons why we're building a new bot and not just keep using the old, closed-source version. With that in mind, we're participating in the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)! Issues labelled `hacktoberfest` will be ideal for new people.
